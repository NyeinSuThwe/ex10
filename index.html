      <p>I had been wandering through the forest longer than I care to admit. The fog was heavy, the air tasted like old secrets, and the trees seemed to lean in when I wasn’t looking. That’s when I saw it — <em>a grin floating in the dark</em>, suspended midair like someone had cut it out of the moon. It didn’t move, but somehow it was <strong>smiling at me</strong>.</p>

      <p>I thought it was a trick of light, so I took a step closer. The grin widened. No sound, no body — just teeth, white as bone and perfectly still. Then two eyes blinked into existence, wide and golden, staring right through me.</p>

      <p>“Where are you going?” a voice purred, smooth as smoke. It didn’t come from ahead or behind — it was everywhere at once. I opened my mouth, but the air was too thick to speak. The grin pulsed brighter, like it was feeding on the silence.</p>

      <p>The creature began to form, piece by piece — stripes, tail, claws — but never all at once. The eyes stayed locked on me while the rest flickered in and out of focus, like a broken reflection. <strong>I realized it wasn’t appearing</strong> — it was deciding how much I deserved to see. My legs trembled, but I couldn’t look away.</p>

      <p>Then, as quickly as it began, everything vanished. The grin lingered for one final heartbeat before fading into the mist, leaving only the echo of its laughter. I finally exhaled, my breath visible in the cold air. When I looked down, the ground beneath me was warm — as if something had just been standing there.</p>
